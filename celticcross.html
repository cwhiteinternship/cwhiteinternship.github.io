<h1>CELTIC CROSS</h1>
<!--End Headline--> 
<!--Subhead--> 
<div class="gallery">The picture from the flea market showed a Celtic Cross with the word “Faith” above it, a wolf on the left side with the word “Family” above it, and an eagle on the right side with the word “Country” above it. Like the last flea market project, I needed to create a file from the photograph I was given. The original also has a light grey background around the wolf and cut off words under the eagle, that I didn’t think was necessary to include in my design as it took away from the overall design. I was able to find a picture of the Celtic Cross online to vectorize along with vectors of an eagle and wolf. I kept the black and white color scheme like the original he provided to us. I created two designs. One was similar to the original, and on the other I incorporated the head of the two animals protruding from the bottom of the cross. Both animals now faced outward instead of towards the cross, and I used a different vector cross that I thought stood out more. In addition to the two designs I created, I used different vectors of each animal to see what the client would prefer. I also incorporated the words like he had in the original.  </div>

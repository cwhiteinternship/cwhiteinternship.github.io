<!--Bio-->
 <div class="frontpage"> 
    <h1>Question:</h1> <p>A personal assessment of what you learned, including comments on whether or not you accomplished your learning goals, how you met unanticipated learning opportunities, and recommendations you have for future students engaged in a similar experience.</p>
    <h1>Answer:</h1> <p>During my internship at Simple Signs, I feel I have learned so much that will affect my future. Areas I felt were specifically helpful were my work with software like flexi, truck lettering, weeding and masking vinyl, designing logos, and learning how the printers work. I think my experiences with these elements of graphic design will be useful in my career. </p>
    <p>Simple Signs also allowed me to have direct contact with clients by phone or in person. I really didnâ€™t expect this. Also, I never realized how fast-paced a business this was. It demonstrated to me what it would be like if I became a designer. </p>
    <p>Future designers would benefit greatly by interning in a place like Simple Signs. Besides knowledge in your field, it also gives you confidence. I think future students need to be open to learning. Also, try to be positive in your thinking and work place. Simple Signs proved to be an invaluable experience, that I enjoyed. </p>
    <h1>Question:</h1> <p> A discussion of the internship in terms of its impact on your future plans.</p>
    <h1>Answer:</h1> <p> My dream job is to join Smart Pak, which is an equine based company out of Plymouth. I would love to work in their catalog department. Since I own horses, I have a knowledge of them. Therefore, I believe this would be an ideal position for me, uniting both my love for horses with my skills as a graphic designer. </p>
    <p>I feel this internship has helped me prepare for this position or one similar to it. Working in the fast-paced environment, interacting with co-workers, and the additional knowledge of printing and designing will be helpful wherever I work. Simple Signs has given me the confidence that I could be successful in this field. Finally, working at Simple Signs is an added bonus on my resume when I apply for jobs. </p>

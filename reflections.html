        <p>My first day at the internship was very educational. First, I had to adjust to the Dell computer instead of the Mac that I’m accustomed to. In addition, instead of the Adobe software, I was introduced to Flexi.</p>
        <p>I took time to adjust to the computer and software, I was given my first project. I worked on Howl-A-Day-Inn doggy day care. I was told to create a couple different logos to send to the client to get his feedback. I went with a bold headline and a softer subhead. The client wanted red, blue, white and black included in the logo. I chose to create a dog vector with a panel, which contained the information. I also showed this design without the dog in different colors. I did something similar with my next idea, when I shaped the logo like a dog bone. If the client wanted, the dog on the bone could be omitted. The last logo I created for this project was a dog silhouette, slightly overlapping the first letter of the headline and his tail bringing your eye down to the next line of text. </p>
        <p>My second project was to create a business card and buy one get one free card for Salty Cow Soft Serve ice cream business. Although the client wanted to incorporate cow print on the front of her cards, we decided it would be over powering and instead placed it on the back. I gave two different examples of the front of the cards with different placings to the show the client how the different options looked and how appealing they were to the eye without the cow print. I was able to incorporate the cow print on the back of the cards but showed examples without it as well. I made the back of the business cards and buy one get one cards match in design. The owner provided specific information of what she wanted on the cards along with the color palette to use. On the buy one get one card, I included “expires with” question marks on the bottom left hand corner because we haven’t been provided the expiration date. </p>
        <p>Finally, I worked on a business sign for Cape Cod Quilts and Cottages. Multiple options had to be created for the client so she could give her opinion and also lead us in the direction she wanted to proceed. There were no boundaries to the colors, but I used her logo colors and square pattern to keep her branding consistent. One thing new that I leaned this day from the company was that they google map images of the clients’ store fronts. Then I could place my design on the photograph of the building, giving the client a better visual. </p>
        <p>was a busy yet enjoyable first day.</p>

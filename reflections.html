        <p>My first day at the internship was very educational. First, I had to adjust to the Dell computer instead of the Mac that I’m accustomed to. In addition, instead of the Adobe software, I was introduced to Flexi.</p>
        <p>I took time to adjust to the computer and software, I was given my first project. I worked on Howl-A-Day-Inn doggy day care. I was told to create a couple different logos to send to the client to get his feedback. I went with a bold headline and a softer subhead. The client wanted red, blue, white and black included in the logo. I chose to create a dog vector with a panel, which contained the information. I also showed this design without the dog in different colors. I did something similar with my next idea, when I shaped the logo like a dog bone. If the client wanted, the dog on the bone could be omitted. The last logo I created for this project was a dog silhouette, slightly overlapping the first letter of the headline and his tail bringing your eye down to the next line of text. </p>
        <p>My second project was to create a business card and buy one get one free card for Salty Cow Soft Serve ice cream business. Although the client wanted to incorporate cow print on the front of her cards, we decided it would be over powering and instead placed it on the back. I gave two different examples of the front of the cards with different placings to the show the client how the different options looked and how appealing they were to the eye without the cow print. I was able to incorporate the cow print on the back of the cards but showed examples without it as well. I made the back of the business cards and buy one get one cards match in design. The owner provided specific information of what she wanted on the cards along with the color palette to use. On the buy one get one card, I included “expires with” question marks on the bottom left hand corner because we haven’t been provided the expiration date. </p>
        <p>Finally, I worked on a business sign for Cape Cod Quilts and Cottages. Multiple options had to be created for the client so she could give her opinion and also lead us in the direction she wanted to proceed. There were no boundaries to the colors, but I used her logo colors and square pattern to keep her branding consistent. One thing new that I leaned this day from the company was that they google map images of the clients’ store fronts. Then I could place my design on the photograph of the building, giving the client a better visual. </p>
        <p>was a busy yet enjoyable first day.</p>

  <p>One my second day, I was involved in three different projects. They were for a poster of insignias, Toly’s Pizza, and Ella’s Bakery. The first project was from the Raynham Flea Market that they were unable to complete at the market.</p>
	<p>poster displaying different insignias was my first project. The purpose of my job was the recreate what the client had on paper into a flexi file. The client did want some minor changes. For example, he wanted a red and blue border and the “Thank you” text in red. First, I found similar logos to the ones in his photograph. I then brought these logos into flexi and made the spaces between logos consistent. Then I added the text, which was very similar to the one on the original photograph. Our office then emailed him what I created to get his feedback.</p>
	<p>that day, I began work on large window stickers for a new company called Toly’s Pizza. My job was to create multiple options for stickers to be used in the four large front windows of his business. Each sticker promoted one of the following: pizza, subs, pasta, and salads. He had two phone numbers, that he wanted to rotate among the four signs. The client wanted to stay with the color palette of red, white, blue, and black, which matched the interior of his restaurant. To help him visualize what the stickers would look like, I chose my favorite option and placed it on a photo of the store front.</p>
	<p>Finally, I worked on creating several logos for Ella’s Bakery. The logo they currently use is very non-professional, so they wanted to update their logo to promote their business. I created several different options using her purple color scheme. I used a baker’s hat, a cupcake, and different kitchen utensils along with typography to create cohesive logos. I chose to use a decorative type face to highlight the name of the bakery. Also, the bakery name I added on the rolling pin looks like it is imprinted into the wood. I created the circular logo with the banner on top of it, to look like a stamp.  The office sent my options to the client for feedback.</p>

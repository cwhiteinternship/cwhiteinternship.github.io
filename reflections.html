  <p>My first day at the internship was very educational. First, I had to adjust to the Dell computer instead of the Mac that I’m accustomed to. In addition, instead of the Adobe software, I was introduced to Flexi.</p>
  <p>After I took time to adjust to the computer and software, I was given my first project. I worked on Howl-A-Day-Inn doggy day care. I was told to create a couple different logos to send to the client to get his feedback. I went with a bold headline and a softer subhead. The client wanted red, blue, white and black included in the logo. I chose to create a dog vector with a panel, which contained the information. I also showed this design without the dog in different colors. I did something similar with my next idea, when I shaped the logo like a dog bone. If the client wanted, the dog on the bone could be omitted. The last logo I created for this project was a dog silhouette, slightly overlapping the first letter of the headline and his tail bringing your eye down to the next line of text. </p>
  <p>My second project was to create a business card and buy one get one free card for Salty Cow Soft Serve ice cream business. Although the client wanted to incorporate cow print on the front of her cards, we decided it would be over powering and instead placed it on the back. I gave two different examples of the front of the cards with different placings to the show the client how the different options looked and how appealing they were to the eye without the cow print. I was able to incorporate the cow print on the back of the cards but showed examples without it as well. I made the back of the business cards and buy one get one cards match in design. The owner provided specific information of what she wanted on the cards along with the color palette to use. On the buy one get one card, I included “expires with” question marks on the bottom left hand corner because we haven’t been provided the expiration date. </p>
  <p>Finally, I worked on a business sign for Cape Cod Quilts and Cottages. Multiple options had to be created for the client so she could give her opinion and also lead us in the direction she wanted to proceed. There were no boundaries to the colors, but I used her logo colors and square pattern to keep her branding consistent. One thing new that I leaned this day from the company was that they google map images of the clients’ store fronts. Then I could place my design on the photograph of the building, giving the client a better visual. </p>
  <p>It was a busy yet enjoyable first day.</p>

  <p>One my second day, I was involved in three different projects. They were for a poster of insignias, Toly’s Pizza, and Ella’s Bakery. The first project was from the Raynham Flea Market that they were unable to complete at the market.</p>
	<p>The poster displaying different insignias was my first project. The purpose of my job was the recreate what the client had on paper into a flexi file. The client did want some minor changes. For example, he wanted a red and blue border and the “Thank you” text in red. First, I found similar logos to the ones in his photograph. I then brought these logos into flexi and made the spaces between logos consistent. Then I added the text, which was very similar to the one on the original photograph. Our office then emailed him what I created to get his feedback.</p>
	<p>Later that day, I began work on large window stickers for a new company called Toly’s Pizza. My job was to create multiple options for stickers to be used in the four large front windows of his business. Each sticker promoted one of the following: pizza, subs, pasta, and salads. He had two phone numbers, that he wanted to rotate among the four signs. The client wanted to stay with the color palette of red, white, blue, and black, which matched the interior of his restaurant. To help him visualize what the stickers would look like, I chose my favorite option and placed it on a photo of the store front.</p>
	<p>Finally, I worked on creating several logos for Ella’s Bakery. The logo they currently use is very non-professional, so they wanted to update their logo to promote their business. I created several different options using her purple color scheme. I used a baker’s hat, a cupcake, and different kitchen utensils along with typography to create cohesive logos. I chose to use a decorative type face to highlight the name of the bakery. Also, the bakery name I added on the rolling pin looks like it is imprinted into the wood. I created the circular logo with the banner on top of it, to look like a stamp.  The office sent my options to the client for feedback.</p>

  <p>There were four projects that I worked on for my third day of the internship. They involved vehicle lettering, stickers, a poster, and a banner.</p>
	<p>The first project was for General Auto of Rhode Island. To begin, I was introduced to Pro Vehicle Outlines, which has vector outlines of all vehicles. This helps a client see how the design will look on the vehicle and helps the designer determine where the design will fit and what size is appropriate. I used their colors (light and dark blue) and their logo to keep the branding consistent. We had to design the doors, front hood, and sides of the box truck. The first example of the box truck side logo and the first example of the front door are similar to their past logo, so I provided them with something similar to what they previously had. The next two examples that I designed for the box truck side logos, I think are more successful. I think it is more visually appealing to have the name of the company straight across, and it gets rid of the awkward white space it the original design. We were provided with all of the information needed on the truck. By rotating between the two company’s colors, I think it is very readable. The third design for the truck’s side corresponds with the second example on the side of the door but excludes the address and website. I also created the front hood design for the truck, which is just the company’s name and recycling logo. Finally, we sent the proofs to the client and are waiting for their feedback.</p> 
	<p>Next, I was asked to create sticker designs for the South Coast Jeep Club. The design was already created but in the shape of a circle. My task was to change the shape to an oval and also change the South Coast Jeep Club lettering on the top and bottom to follow the arch of the shape. While working on this project, I learned that the pattern for the text they are using is called engine turn. This was a quick and simple project.</p>
	<p>For this project, I had my first opportunity to meet and interact with a client. He provided me with the size, colors (red and blue), and information he wanted me to use for his gala night invitation for the Haitian Church. In decorative arched typography, I highlighted the purpose of the poster. I made sure that the actual text inviting you was bolder to catch your eye. I separated the information and the reason for the gala dinner along with the donation by using a small decorative design. Originally, the background was white, but after talking with the client, we decided to add a photograph of a gala night with lowered opacity to show what the gala dinner would entail. The client was very pleased with the outcome of the project.</p> 
	<p>Finally, I created a banner of congratulations for a high school graduation. His high school colors were dark blue, and the college he would be attending in the fall also used dark blue and light blue. I chose to use a decorative script font with the headline “Congratulations Ben” but for the rest of the text, I used a serif type face. I decided to incorporate the name of the high school and his future college as well as the college’s logo. Between the name of the high school and college, I added “Class of 2019”. Around the congratulatory section of the banner, I used an outline to emphasize the purpose of the banner.</p>
	<p>It was another enjoyable day designing multiple, diverse projects. It was very rewarding meeting with a client for the first time and seeing how pleased he was with the outcome.</p>

  <p>On the next day at Simple Signs, I worked on two projects. The first was a poster from the flea market. The second one was a business sign for a salon. Also, on this day the owner of Simple Signs showed me past projects that his business has created from the flea market.</p>
  <p>The picture from the flea market showed a Celtic Cross with the word “Faith” above it, a wolf on the left side with the word “Family” above it, and an eagle on the right side with the word “Country” above it. Like the last flea market project, I needed to create a file from the photograph I was given. The original also has a light grey background around the wolf and cut off words under the eagle, that I didn’t think was necessary to include in my design as it took away from the overall design. I was able to find a picture of the Celtic Cross online to vectorize along with vectors of an eagle and wolf. I kept the black and white color scheme like the original he provided to us. I created two designs. One was similar to the original, and on the other I incorporated the head of the two animals protruding from the bottom of the cross. Both animals now faced outward instead of towards the cross, and I used a different vector cross that I thought stood out more. In addition to the two designs I created, I used different vectors of each animal to see what the client would prefer. I also incorporated the words like he had in the original.</p> 
  <p>Beauty by Caitlin is a salon in Marston Mills, and it became my second project of the day. The client wanted a sign for outside her business. She wanted this sign to match the front of her business cards. I also provided her with a different example where the sub text would be bigger and easier to read from the road. We are waiting to hear which option she prefers.</p>
  <p>The owner of Simple Signs, Charlie, showed me the multiple different projects from the flea market that they were hired to design. Many projects are small designs that are printed immediately for younger clients who want a decal for their car. Also attending the flea market are many business owners who want their logos printed on t-shirts and sweatshirts. There are also clients that only have a print out of a design but need it created into a file, like a few of the projects I have worked on. One interesting one was a man who wanted to create bumper stickers for his wife, who was looking for a type O donor for a kidney transplant. Hopefully, he received some responses. I enjoyed looking at the wide variety of projects.</p>

  <p>Today was a day at the bay. I started by learning about all of the printers, laminators, plotters, and different vinyls, as well as the machines used for screening logos on apparel. Then I started learning how to weed the 3M vinyl that we use for truck lettering. For my first task, I helped prepare the truck by thoroughly cleaning the surface where the logo would go. Because it was a large logo one of the lettering employees and I were each on a ladder measuring where the design was to be placed on the truck. We then took the backing off the vinyl and squeegeed it on. The vinyl we use is very easy to take a wrinkle or air bubble out.</p>
  <p>After I helped letter the truck, I sent the South Coast Jeep Club stickers, that I had worked on earlier, to the plotter where contour lines were made around the design. I then used the cutter and made separate rectangles for each individual sticker. Then they were ready to be sent to the client.</p>
  <p>Finally, my day at the bay consisted of putting the Mosquito Squad, who are out of Wellfleet, vinyl on the back of their van. This was a job I did by myself. This vinyl was already weeded and ready to be put on the van. I cleaned off the window, and then measured so the vinyl would be placed in the center of the window. Then I took the backing off and squeegeed it down. Next, I took the front adhesive off and made sure there were no bubbles. Because the decal was positioned in the middle of an opening door, I had to cut where the division was. Now that the project was complete, I can’t wait to see the van driving around.</p>

<p>Today, I worked on several miscellaneous tasks to help prepare for the busy week ahead. My work included taking vinyl off of two trucks, cutting stickers, putting stickers on magnets, and weeding vinyl.</p>
<p>First, I started removing old vinyl from two trucks so a new updated logo could be applied. The steps included applying heat to a small area so the vinyl could be peeled off. I repeated this process until all the vinyl was removed. Since the vinyl left a sticky coating, I sprayed citrus spray on the area, let it sit for a few minutes, and then with a rubber squeegee I was able to scrape the residue off. Lastly, I sprayed alcohol over the area to prepare for the application on the new vinyl.</p> 
<p>Then 500 stickers were brought from the bay for a new company, so my task was to cut them in sets of five. The stickers came in huge rolls of 100.</p>
<p>Next, I worked with one of the truck lettering employees to put heavy duty stickers on magnets, that will be placed on the truck. We started by cutting the magnet size to his specifications. Then we sprayed the back of the magnets with alcohol to remove any impurities. Next, we measured to make sure the stickers were centered to the magnet and taped it down. Then, we took the backing off half of the sticker and squeegeed it down. We repeated this step for the second half. Lastly, with an x-acto knife, we cut off the excess sticker around the edges. This client chose to apply magnets to his truck instead of the vinyl that would be directly applied to his truck.</p>
<p>The last task of the day was weeding vinyl for multiple trucks for a new company, that were going to be lettered the next day. After the weeding process was complete, another employee helped me mask down tape over the vinyl, so it was ready to go on the trucks.</p>
<p>It was another busy day at Simple Signs.</p>

  <p>When I arrived Monday morning, I had several jobs awaiting me like applying vinyl to an A-frame and plexiglass, cutting stickers, creating a “for sale” sign, and two projects for the Raynham Flea Market.</p>
  <p>First, I worked on the vinyl application to the A-frame and plexiglass. I wiped down the surface of the A-frame with alcohol. Then I used a tack cloth to go over the surface again, removing any additional particles. Once that was done, I took the back off the vinyl and made sure it was centered on the A-frame. After laying it down, I squeegeed it. Lastly, I peeled off the tape that was on the vinyl. Then I made sure the letters were on with no air bubbles. I repeated these steps on the other side of the A-frame. For the plexiglass, I repeated this process.</p>
	<p>My next job was to cut stickers for multiple clients. This is easy to do, but I have to make sure not to cut any edges of the stickers. Once they’re cut, I put each clients’ stickers in a separate envelope with their sticker on top to identify the client.</p>
	<p>The “for sale” sign was a very quick and easy job. A gentleman wanted us to design and print a “for sale” sign for a house. He knew exactly what colors and design he wanted when he entered the shop.</p>
	<p>Lastly, I designed two things for the Raynham Flea Market. The first project was creating a code of conduct sign. They had seen one they liked but wanted us to reproduce it with their colors and a few minor changes. I added the flea markets mascot for an additional touch. They also wanted parking signs. My job was to design a few different options with their mascot and colors. We sent them to the client and are waiting to hear their feedback.</p>
	<p>Today seemed very busy because two of my coworkers were not there.</p>

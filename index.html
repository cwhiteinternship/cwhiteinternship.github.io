          <p>Simple Signs of Cape Cod is a company that specializes in designing vehicle lettering, business signs, banners, and anything else that is needed to promote a customer’s business. This company is located in Yarmouth, MA., and has been in business for eleven years. It’s a smaller company. The office is located on Route 28, a main street, which is a prime business location.</p>
          <p>Clients arrange appointments at the main office, where the details of their needs are designed. Once there is a secure design and the customer is pleased, the client must approve it and provide a deposit of 50% before any work is continued. Once approved, the design is sent to the garage bay, where it’s printed and processed. Although being a smaller company with approximately ten employees, they still service customers throughout Eastern Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>There are two sections: designing and printing. Each section has a manager who is responsible for his area. The owner of the business is the overseer. Overall, the company has a very casual environment, but the work is fast-paced. Everyone is busy fulfilling the clients needs.</p>
          <p>One unusual custom is done every Sunday is at the Raynham Flea Market. There the owner and one employee work together to design and print with same day results. If the project is too big, it is brought back to the office where designers confer with the client. These bigger projects have a one-week turnaround time and are brought back to the flea market the next week. Many of these customers know what they want, but don’t have the files so usually we just re-create their designs. This really promotes our business.</p>
          <p>Simple Signs of Cape Cod offers a wide variety of designs, which appealed to me when looking for my internship. Everyone has been welcoming, friendly, and I feel like I’m learning a lot there.</p>

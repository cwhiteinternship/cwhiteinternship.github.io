<h1>GENERAL AUTO</h1>
<!--End Headline--> 
<!--Subhead--> 
<div class="gallery">This project was for General Auto of Rhode Island. To begin, I was introduced to Pro Vehicle Outlines, which has vector outlines of all vehicles. This helps a client see how the design will look on the vehicle and helps the designer determine where the design will fit and what size is appropriate. I used their colors (light and dark blue) and their logo to keep the branding consistent. We had to design the doors, front hood, and sides of the box truck. The first example of the box truck side logo and the first example of the front door are similar to their past logo, so I provided them with something similar to what they previously had. The next two examples that I designed for the box truck side logos, I think are more successful. I think it is more visually appealing to have the name of the company straight across, and it gets rid of the awkward white space it the original design. We were provided with all of the information needed on the truck. By rotating between the two company’s colors, I think it is very readable. The third design for the truck’s side corresponds with the second example on the side of the door but excludes the address and website. I also created the front hood design for the truck, which is just the company’s name and recycling logo. Finally, we sent the proofs to the client and are waiting for their feedback.  </div>
